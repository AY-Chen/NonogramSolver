# NonogramSolver
A program to solve nonograms given the set of numbers along the sides. 
Written in Python 3.6, the project will be comprised of multiple main functionalities: 
  1. To be able to represent a nonogram as an object.
  2. To be able to verify whether a given solution is correct.
  3. To be able to solve a puzzle given the hints(numbers along the sides) assuming that the puzzle has a unique solution.
  4. Finally, if possible, determine whether or not a puzzle is uniquely solveable, and generate a solution if it is.
